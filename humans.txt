 I think humans, despite our many faults, are truly the most awesome living thing this planet has ever seen.
 Collectively we managed to control fire and use it to process raw materials found scattered around the planet.
 Were were able to put these natural resources together in particular ways and harness unique properties in
 chemistry, electricity, magnetism, thermodynamics, etc to build machines and computers. We can now communicate with
 other humans accross the planet and collaborate in real time to share, learn and build together like never before.
